<p style="font-size:20">
The COVID-19 pandemic is by no means over, but in 2022, D.C.’s arts and<br> entertainment venues have at least approached normalcy. That is to say, theater<br> companies are presenting shows on stage as opposed to online. Live music and dance<br> parties (and the people who choose to attend those events) are returning to bars as well.<br> After going without these little luxuries for so long, audiences (and our writers and<br> contributors) were particularly excited for this year’s arts events.<br><br>

But enjoying the arts doesn’t mean you have to head to a crowded venue. If books and<br> documentaries are more your speed, we’ve got commendations for those as well.</p>

<h1>BEST PRE-BROADWAY RUN
</h1>

<h2><i>A Strange Loop</i></h2>

<p style="font-size:20">I should probably start this by saying, I don’t care much for musicals. But Michael R.<br> Jackson’s <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/542131/a-strange-loop-is-exile-in-gayville/">Pulitzer Prize-winning musical</a>, <i>A Strange Loop</i>, was enough to make me <br>reconsider my stance. Some naysayers might attempt to argue that the story is too<br> niche: a Black queer playwright, working as a Broadway usher, writing a play about a<br> Black queer playwright working as a Broadway usher. But the production, staged at<br> Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in early 2022 before it made its Broadway debut <br>and picked up two Tonys, exemplifies exactly why we need more stories from queer and<br> BIPOC writers. There’s nothing unrelatable about the story, at least not for anyone <br>who’s ever struggled with family relationships, been unlucky in love, grappled with<br> attaining their dreams, or suffered from self-hatred.<i> A Strange Loop</i> beautifully,<br> eloquently, and hilariously offers a new perspective on those evergreen stories. The<br> play’s stars, led by Jaquel Spivey, succeeded in New York with good reason. The nuance,<br> the feeling, the vibrancy of every performance was enough to make audiences truly feel<br> for them. Woolly Mammoth aims to be a theater that “produces courageous and<br> invigorating new work to radically redefine theatre as a catalyst for an equitable,<br> creative, and engaged society.” With A Strange Loop, they couldn’t have done a better<br> job.  —<strong>Sarah Marloff</strong></p>

<h1 style="font-size:25">BEST THEATER TO SEE IN UNCONVENTIONAL SETTINGS</h1>

<h2 style="font-size:30">Rorschach Theatre</h2>

<p style="font-size:20">Theatrical tourism meets epistolary performance meets scavenger hunt in multiple<br> productions from Rorschach Theatre this season. The company incorporates uncommon<br> theatrical practices into uncommon theatrical spaces to keep audiences engaged and<br> invigorated. Rorschach is lauded for its innovative productions that demonstrate a<br> passion for storytelling, tackling challenging material, and cutting edge direction. It has<br> produced work in traditional theater spaces such as the Silver Spring Black Box or Atlas<br> Performing Arts Center in the past, but leaders have recently developed productions<br> that occupy D.C. neighborhoods at large. The 2020–2021 season brought an immersive<br> experiment titled Distance Frequencies, an exciting storytelling project that combined <br>the natural and material realms of the city. As a socially distanced performance, the <br>work emphasized the idea that theater can be more than what takes place on stage. With<br> participants in and beyond the DMV, this seven-chapter project was swiftly followed by<br> <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/564466/tripping-through-the-multiverse-with-chemical-exile-synthesis/">Chemical Exile</a> and the beginning of a multi-season endeavor, Psychogeographies.<br> Rorschach’s artistic producer and one of its founders, Jonelle Walker, says this year’s<br> Psychogeographies project, entitled <i>Dissonant City</i>, will use “well-researched history<br> and imaginative narratives to transform average city streets into mind-expanding<br> immersive experiences. Audiences get to place themselves in the story as they explore<br> twists, turns, and lesser known D.C. sites—like the National Park Service’s only roller<br> rink or replicas of the Holy Land in Brookland.” Headed into the new season,<br> Rorschach’s current production of Kate Hamill’s<a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/576424/dracula-a-feminist-revenge-fantasy-really-puts-women-front-and-center/"> Dracula</a> brings an exciting script into<br> the walls of a foreclosed firehouse. —<strong>Melissa Lin Sturges</strong></p>

<h1>BEST WORLD PREMIERE</h1>

<h4 style="font-size:40"><i>John Proctor Is the Villain</i></h4>

<p style="font-size:20">What would happen if we believed women first? When I <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/556515/not-a-witch-hunt-john-proctor-is-the-villain-in-a-post-metoo-world/">reviewed</a> <i>John Proctor Is the<br> Villain</i>, I noted that this is the question playwright Kimberly Belflower dares to ask. In<br> 2022, that shouldn’t feel like a radical stance to take, let alone a radical question to ask,<br> but then, it’s also my opinion that in 2022 all people should be able to access free and<br> safe abortions too. Belflower’s play, which made its world premiere at Studio Theatre in<br> the spring of 2022, takes from Arthur Miller’s 1953 play The Crucible, the #MeToo<br> movement, and a generation of teen dramas to present a thesis that gets to heart of rape<br> culture: Generally, people would rather believe “good” guys don’t do bad things than<br> believe women. Though set in 2018, shortly after dozens of famous women reported<br> Harvey Weinstein’s abuse and the same year that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford told the<br> world that then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her<br> in high school, the story remains timely. While Weinstein—currently on trial for 11 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/24/us/harvey-weinstein-trial-los-angeles.html">new<br> charges of sexual assault in L.A.</a>—may have been sentenced to 23 years in prison for<br> rape and criminal sexual assault, the New York Court of Appeals has allowed the<br> disgraced producer to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-yorks-highest-court-allows-harvey-weinstein-appeal-rape-conviction-2022-08-24/">appeal his conviction</a>. Kavanaugh now sits on the country’s<br> highest court. And, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-depp-heard-verdict-is-chilling">despite mountains of evidence</a> against him, Johnny Depp won his<br> defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard in June. Though these real women<br> should humanize such stories, Belflower’s play offers greater insight into not only the<br> women who come forward but the people who struggle to believe them. —<strong>Sarah<br> Marloff</strong></p>

<h1>BEST MUSEUM MEMBERSHIP</h1>

<h2 style="font-size:35">The Hirshhorn</h2>

<p style="font-size:20">When the Hirshhorn opened its latest exhibit,<i> Put It This Way</i>, in August, the museum<br> opened its doors to members for a special preview. After the museum closed to the <br>public for the day, members gathered to check out pieces from women and nonbinary<br> artists in a variety of media. This was a relaxed event, not an academic one, so the tours <br>by museum staff were not exhaustive. Instead, they offered a “mini tour,” one where a<br> docent or curator would have people gather around a piece and talk about it for a few<br> minutes. The discussion was strained at first, as it can be intimidating to share your<br> opinion on art around strangers. But the conversation opened up, and folks started<br> bouncing ideas off another. In just 15 minutes, it was a surprisingly fruitful discussion.<br> Unexpected, gently provocative moments like this one are why I maintain a membership <br>with the Hirshhorn. Sure, my wife and I joined for the most obvious reason—early<br> access to the Yayoi Kusama <a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/552435/yayoi-kusamas-one-with-eternity-is-designed-for-gaggles-of-visitors/">Infinity Rooms</a>—although the perks extend beyond that, <br>with early access to all the terrific programming in a more social setting. (The evening<br> events always include a cash bar, with no drinking in the galleries, of course.) But the <br>best reason to invest in this museum, beyond all the perks listed on the museum’s<br> website, is the least obvious: All the Hirshhorn events make for terrific people watching.<br> You get sharply dressed folks with every stitch in place mixing among folks in clever<br> punk t-shirts, and others still who look like they just stepped out of their own art studio<br> space. People dress up for these events or they are unabashedly themselves, wanting to <br>see and be seen, serving as an unintentional rejoinder that “this town” is too stuffy and<br> without style. —<strong>Alan Zilberman</strong></p>
